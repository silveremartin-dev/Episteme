## Abstract

This paper describes **JScience**, a comprehensive general science API written in Java. Unlike traditional scientific libraries that focus solely on numerical recipes, JScience provides a semantic framework for modeling scientific concepts—from Quantum Mechanics to Sociology. Our goal is to cover the full spectrum of scientific knowledge, distributed freely under open-source licenses. In this 2025 edition, we present the revitalized architecture, featuring arbitrary-precision arithmetic, hardware acceleration, and a unified domain model.

## Introduction

Scientific computing has historically been dominated by Fortran and C++. However, Java's evolution—offering rigorous type safety, object-oriented design, and now competitive performance via Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation and foreign memory access—makes it an ideal platform for complex scientific systems. JScience leverages these capabilities to prioritize **correctness** and **maintainability** without sacrificing performance.

## Architecture Overview

The JScience project (2025) is organized into three primary modules:

1. **`jscience-core`**: The mathematical engine.
    * **Arbitrary Precision**: Built on `org.jscience.mathematics.numbers.real.Real`, enabling calculations where precision is limited only by memory, not hardware floating-point constraints.
    * **Linear Algebra**: Generic Matrix and Vector implementations supporting field-agnostic operations.
    * **Hardware Acceleration**: Service-provider interfaces (`CPUDenseLinearAlgebraProvider`, `CUDADenseLinearAlgebraProvider`) allow offloading heavy computations to GPUs seamlessly.
    * **Structure**: Categories, Groups, Rings, Fields vector spaces.

2. **`jscience-natural`**: The domain application layer.
    * **Physics**: Classical Mechanics, Relativity, Quantum Physics, Thermodynamics.
    * **Chemistry**: Periodic Table, Molecular Dynamics, Stoichiometry.
    * **Biology**: DNA/RNA sequencing, Codon mapping.
    * **Sociology/Economics**: Emerging modules for soft science modeling.

3. **`jscience-benchmarks`**: A standardized suite to measure performance against naive implementations and other libraries.

## The Semantic Difference

Most scientific libraries are collections of functions (e.g., `fft(double[] data)`). JScience is a collection of **concepts**.

* **Type Safety**: You cannot accidentally add `Mass` to `Length`. The `Quantity<T>` system ensures dimensional consistency at compile time.
* **Arbitrary Precision**: While legacy parts of the system still utilize primitive `double` for performance trade-offs, the core architecture is moving towards ubiquitous `Real` usage, allowing users to define the required precision context dynamically.
* **Object-Oriented**: A `Particle` in JScience isn't just a position vector; it's an entity with Mass, Charge, Spin, and interactions defined by interfaces like `Relativistic` or `QuantumMechanical`.

## Key Features

### 1. High-Performance Linear Algebra across Platforms

JScience automatically detects available acceleration hardware. For small matrices, it uses optimized CPU algorithms. For large simulations (like N-Body problems), it can dispatch operations to CUDA-enabled GPUs, transparent to the user.

### 2. Signal Processing

The unified `SignalProcessing` framework provides Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), filtering (High-pass, Low-pass), and spectral analysis using both primitive double precision (for speed) and `Real` precision (for accuracy).

### 3. Data Externalization

Hardcoded scientific constants are a thing of the past. JScience loads data (Isotopes, Planets, Codon Tables) from external JSON resources, making the library extensible without recompilation.

## Weaknesses & Roadmap

While powerful, the current version (2025) acknowledges certain limitations:

* **Precision Gap**: Some "natural" science modules still rely on 64-bit floating point math (`double`), creating a precision gap with the "core" math engine. Phase 10 of our roadmap targets a comprehensive conversion to `Real`.
* **Soft Sciences**: Modules for Sociology and Economics are currently in early modeling stages.
* **Documentation**: We are actively improving Javadoc coverage to assist new adopters.

## Conclusion

JScience represents the modern approach to scientific software: Strongly typed, semantically rich, and hardware-aware. It bridges the gap between theoretical correctness and computational efficiency, providing a robust foundation for the next generation of scientific applications.

Abstract
This paper describes JScience, a general science API (Application Programmer Interface) written in
Java. This API comes in two flavors: one main distribution and another experimental one. Our aim
was to cover all knowledge (but database content) up to bachelor graduation level or higher and
distribute it for free under GPL license. JScience is the first API ever to do so.
In this paper, I argue that Java offers a different environment from previous languages (C, C++,
Fortran) which allows to write a better science API (speed, portability, code quality, features,
reusability, extensibility). We hope that this API will define a model for future scientific computing
software (OS level service, object oriented, open source, wide spectrum).
Introduction

## Architecture Overview

The JScience project is organized into several core packages:

* `org.jscience.mathematics` – mathematical foundations, sequences, series, dynamical systems.
* `org.jscience.physics` – physical models, including the new `electricity` sub‑package.
* `org.jscience.physics.electricity` – circuit components such as Resistor, Capacitor, Inductor, VoltageSource, CurrentSource, SimpleCircuit, SeriesCircuit, ParallelCircuit.
* `org.jscience.mathematics.logic.connector` (renamed to `connectors`) – interfaces for proof import/export (Coq, Qedeq, Metamath).
* `org.jscience.backend` – technical backend utilities (moved to `org.jscience.technicals.backend`).

These packages provide a modular, extensible foundation for scientific computing in Java.
There is a lot of scientific software available for free on the Internet. Yet, actually, there is two
markets that have been poorly addressed by software developers. First, science packages cover
almost exclusively mathematics. Some of them cover also some hard sciences (physics, chemistry
and biology) but there is very few code in soft sciences. Then, most science packages focus
numerical computation, not science software development. What we have is commercial software
that helps solve numerical problems but is of no use if we want to make standalone applications.
JScience effort has been made into existence as two separate API. The official distribution, which is
small, written in Java 1.5 (generics, boxing...) is targeted towards core mathematics and unit
systems makes a nice introduction to the scientific computing world. Its description is already
covered in a separate communication. The other distribution is experimental, it has a much wider
scope and uses the unit system from the main distribution. This is the distribution I discuss in this
paper though much of what is said could apply to the official distribution.
Numerical computation survey
We know for long that Java is a good candidate for scientific computation. It is fast, almost as much
as C++ in general and about half the speed of Fortran. It is also object oriented (which is not the
case of Fortran) and documented (which is not the case of C++).
This makes Java an ideal choice because it is much less expensive to leverage scientific computing
solutions than others competing languages. Yes, your code may execute a bit slower but it will cost
you much less to develop and maintain. So, you can actually use the same money to buy faster
machines. Moreover, because accuracy is a critical component in scientific computing you are
taking much less risks using Java that stack overflow or other kind of hard to trace errors ever
appear.
History of JScience
JScience started from a couple of unrelated projects. Mark Hale had developed Jsci from 1999 and
ongoing. His focus was on mathematics and physics. Jean-Marie Dautelle had been working on
JADE (Java Additions to Default Environment) from 2000 targeting unit systems and mathematics.
I was, on my side, working with Digital Biosphere, a 3D virtual environment struggling with
geography, physics and astronomy. In year 2004, after having produced some code for Jsci, I
offered Jean-Marie Dautelle to merge some code into a new project. He accepted, partly because he
had copyright problems with the name JADE. From then on, we try to produce a general scientific
API in Java.
The problem we faced is however not new. Many open source developers start building their project
from scratch reusing few code from others, wasting time and energy because they are not able to
find a good code base accepted fully by the community.
There is therefore a lot of unfinished scientific projects available over the Internet. One of the key
ideas of JScience was to reuse this effort and adapt code from others to the new architecture rather
than rewrite everything.
JScience, the concept
JScience aims to be a general science API in Java. We want to cover all knowledge (but databases
contents that you will have to get elsewhere) up to graduation level or better. We also want it to be
cost free and open source (delivered under GPL) because we want people to be able to use it the
way they need it. Finally, we want JScience as a framework, that is, a conceptually sound set of
tools that work together to provide something efficient.
We target researchers mostly but we hope to gain some interest from corporate projects. We, at
JScience, are ourselves a bunch of engineers and researchers, mostly computer enthusiasts with
common passion for science.
Our approach is to use Java 1.5, think of objects as first rank citizens (and use less utility classes),
use XML support as much as possible and implement international and acclaimed standards
whenever they exist. Yet, we admit this is a very new domain and we are therefore leading the way
for hopefully better efforts.
The product
Our continuous effort over the last years has produced the widest science API effort ever (with
more features than all existing C++ or Fortran scientific API).
We have one website for communication and two sub websites for development using the dev.java
platform provided by Sun Microsystems for open source developers. We maintain a couple mailing
lists and bug tracking systems.
Our software packages are:
• Official distribution at version 4.3, around 200 classes distributed as a 2MB zip
• Experimental distribution at version 1.0b, around 4400 classes distributed as a 25 MB zip1
Though the official package covers only core mathematics and unit systems, the experimental
distribution reuses the code from the units systems (but a separate code for mathematics) and covers
architecture, astronomy, bibliography, biology, chemistry, computing, earth science, economics,
geography, history, law, linguistics, mathematics, medicine, physics, philosophy, politics,
psychology and social sciences.
In fact, the only not covered by the experimental distribution is education. The reason is that there
are many competing distance education frameworks around that would overlap and do a better job
that JScience.
Benefits
The first benefit of using JScience is that it cuts down development costs dramatically. Not only
developers have a very wide API to build their code upon, but JScience provides fast algorithms
that normal developers would have trouble to design and debug should they do so. The reason is
that scientific computing is hard and code is made by field experts. Though it is completely
unsound, many developers start their development from scratch and try to redesign these highly
technical algorithms.
Moreover, should you find a bug in JScience, or would like a new feature, we develop it for free
and include it in the next release making sure that we have the most efficient algorithm.
On the opposite, you can ask that some new scientific module you have developed is added to
JScience architecture. This means that your code can be part of the library and that you will only
have to focus on your real application code in the future.
Of course, when you use JScience you have all the standard advantages of using Java software:
portability, object oriented code, memory management, error propagation, internationalization,
embedded XML support and auto generated documentation (a must see feature for a scientific API).
This language helps to design elegant code (code quality) that is both easy to maintain and opens
the way for implementation of new features without breaking the underlying model (extensibility)2.
As it has been said earlier, Java is fast enough for scientific computation, almost as fast as its best
competitor languages. Moreover, though we currently lack our own global benchmarking software,
we have proven on our website that some parts of our code3 is even faster than the genuine Java
1 We have actually 3 distributions "levels" for the experimental code, each containing the classes from the one from
lower level: core mathematics only, hard sciences and soft sciences. This is convenient for the users which can
bundle a smaller API with their product. We also maintain a separate distribution without any Java code but only
data files.
2 In fact, it would probably be impossible to write and maintain such an API in any other language than Java. The
library would be too big in Fortran without object oriented support (aside Fortran 2003) and useless in C++ because
it lacks a proper documentation tool. Doxygen can help to provide such a documentation but it is not a standard tool
of C++ and generated documentation would therefore be not of much help to the users of this science library.
3 The JScience library is based on the real time Java library Javolution, which is designed by one of the JScience
founders (Jean-Marie Dautelle).
code that comes from the Java Runtime Environment (the official implementation of the Java
language from Sun Microsystems).
The idea to build a wide science library makes sense because we hope that this library will be
someday (or at least parts of it) included in the core Java language distribution. As a matter of fact,
the unit system used in JScience is now formally developed as JSR 275 (so called Units
specification), the official Java Community Process (JCP) from Sun Microsystems for future
extensions of the Java language API.
The people at JScience think that scientific computation should be a service available at OS level
along with I/O, GUI or networking API. This is also why JScience tries to stick to all existing
standards rather than define new ones. Especially, we try to support XML oriented data.
JScience tries to provide a model close to theoretical science concepts rather than just provide a
numerical wrap up without correct foundations. As such, it supports infinite precision computation.
Finally, there is something very interesting happening with JScience. Because we have coded the
underlying concepts of most sciences, each time we now add a new module, less and less code has
to be produced because we reuse much code from the other modules.
For example, the
• org.jscience.sociology.Person class extends
• org.jscience.biology.human.Human which itself extends
• org.jscience.biology.HistoricalIndividual (an organism with some chronological data) which
itself extends
• org.jscience.biology.Individual, itself basically a
• java.util.Set (or org.jscience.mathematics.FiniteSet) of org.jscience.biology.Organs, itself a
• java.util.Set of org.jscience.biology.Tissues, itself a
• java.util.Set of org.jscience.biology.Cells which contain
• org.jscience.biology.DNA or org.jscience.biology.RNA stored in
• org.jscience.biology.Genome as org.jscience.biology.Chains4.
Many other classes are used in the same way. This is very efficient because if you now need to
access the DNA of the Person, you can get it without the need for a further line of code, because of
Java object oriented features and JScience wide scientific spectrum approach.
For our team, it seems that JScience fills a gap in scientific software. If you only need a couple
Matrix operations to support some computation in you application, JScience is probably not a good
choice. On the opposite, if you need to use some units of measure, to display graphs, to access some
standard data, to open some standard file formats and to have ready to use high level science
targeted objects, JScience is a must see.
The future of JScience
We hope that in the near future we will get a wider interest from the community. We really look
forward more support and recognition from other scientific computing people, especially the ones
4 Amusingly, these are in turn available as
• org.jscience.chemistry.Molecules made up of
• org.jscience.chemistry.Atoms treated as
• org.jscience.physics.Particles.
that have used traditional languages since then.
We also expect to grow in audience outside academic or big business companies.
We plan to enhance the API with some more packages. Yet our main effort will be to provide
better, faster algorithms for existing features. For example, we plan to have better, explicit parallel
support. Of course, we will also make some more documentation and design some new samples.
Possible trends for numerical computing
In my opinion, future progress in numerical computing in general will come from further research
in a couple areas where work has already begun:
● Multi-inheritance: single inheritance of objects like in Java is not fully adequate for science.
● Solid foundations through direct translation of scientific concepts (arbitrary precision
computation, axiomatics, true mathematics): packages are not numerical recipes but can be
real food for thought and mirror the way science itself is designed
● New methods in numerical computing: new algorithms and new approaches (like finite
elements for example) can be invented and implemented.
● Meta languages: use of parsers and some new languages (Fortress for example) could be
more suited to describe some scientific domains than traditional programming languages.
● Models for social sciences: social sciences are only at the beginning, much improvement can
be done by defining core concepts like it is done in physics, biology and chemistry.
Conclusion
JScience has made a reputation of its own in the small but growing world of scientific computing. It
is regarded as quality software in the Java and some of its code is used as a base for the JSR 275
official Java language extension for Unit specification.
JScience is the starting point of a new generation of scientific API that makes use of object oriented
features as well as garbage collection, just in time compilation and error management (thanks to
Java). It is completely open source, fast, accurate and available now.
