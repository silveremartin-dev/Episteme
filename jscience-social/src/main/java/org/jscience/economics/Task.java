/**
 * A class representing the transformation of some materials and some human
 * ressources into a finished something that can be sold. A product (whether
 * primary or secondary, that is, already transformed) is a material thing. A
 * service is a kind of immaterial product (like having a hair cut). Work is
 * also known as task. Each task can in turn be divided further on into
 * subtasks to further describe each process.

//even the most basic work require some resources
//for example cutting someone's hair require cisors, guarding a tower requires weapons (googles...)
//note that these resources should also be in the product list (as they are sort of recycled in the process)
//of course you can always subdivide any task in many more tasks, arrange them in hierarchies or whatever
//the way we define task does require a workforce but there is no direct links to Workers that could help you define such a work
//people in fact usually work on many projects at once and also you can assign them to a work, you can't really compute the workforce
//you therefore have to subclass this class and provide a Set holder of Workers should you want to design a project manager
//a task may be carried over in many different ways (although there is usually one more efficient than the others)
//tasks generally involve using specific process(es)
