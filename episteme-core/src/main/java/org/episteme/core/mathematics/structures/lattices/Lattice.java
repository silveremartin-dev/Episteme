/**
 * A lattice is a set equipped with two commutative, associative and idempotent
 * binary operations: join (Ã¢Ë†Â¨) and meet (Ã¢Ë†Â§), connected by absorption laws.
 *
 * <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
 * <p>
 * A lattice (L, Ã¢Ë†Â¨, Ã¢Ë†Â§) satisfies:
 * <ul>
 * <li>(L, Ã¢Ë†Â¨) is a semilattice (Join)</li>
 * <li>(L, Ã¢Ë†Â§) is a semilattice (Meet)</li>
 * <li><strong>Absorption Laws</strong>:
 * <ul>
 * <li>a Ã¢Ë†Â¨ (a Ã¢Ë†Â§ b) = a</li>
 * <li>a Ã¢Ë†Â§ (a Ã¢Ë†Â¨ b) = a</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Boolean Algebra ({0,1}, OR, AND)</li>
 * <li>Power Set (P(S), Ã¢Ë†Âª, Ã¢Ë†Â©)</li>
 * <li>Natural Numbers (Ã¢â€žâ€¢, max, min)</li>
 * <li>Divisibility (Ã¢â€žâ€¢, lcm, gcd)</li>
 * </ul>
