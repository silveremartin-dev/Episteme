 * This class is used to encapsulate the various wavelet multiresolution

 * and with real numbers. It is meant to provide only the most basic methods
 * in order to be as general as possible. Also, for performance
 * considerations, this class should be as light as possible. However, in
 * practice, it is useful to put most of the actual implementation in a
 * multiresolution object instead of spreading it over many objects.
