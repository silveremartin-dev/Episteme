VIRTUAL PLANTS
==============

This Diploma work is a computer graphics project made at the University
of applied sciences in Biel, Switzerland. http://www.hta-bi.bfh.ch
The taks is to simulate the growth of 3 dimensional plants and show
them in a virtual world.
This work is based on the ideas of Lindenmayer and Prusinkiewicz which
are taken from the book 'The algorithmic beauty of plants'.
The Java and Java3D classes have to be used for this work. This file
is one class of the program. For more information look at the VirtualPlants
homepage at: http://www.hta-bi.bfh.ch/Projects/VirtualPlants
