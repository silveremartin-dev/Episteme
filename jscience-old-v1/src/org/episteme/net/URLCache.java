/**
 * A wrapper around java.net.URL that caches a copy of the content
 * and adds some additional functionality designed for HTML pages. <p>
 * The URLCache cache can be made up-to-date by calling <code>refresh()</code>.<br>
 * The URLCache object also maintains the time when it was last updated successfully.
 * The method <code>lastUpdated()</code> will return that time. <p>
 * Most methods operate on the cached data to avoid the need to reconnect
 * over the web for each operation. This allows to call several methods on a
 * URLCache object sequentially with reasonable performance. <p>
 * If a call to a content accessing method is first made and the data has not
 * been cached yet, the method will enforce a refresh and wait for completion.
 * If the content could not be refreshed due to an IOException, that
 * exception is then immediately thrown as well as in all subsequent method
 * calls accessing the content. <p>
 * <p/>
 * If <code>refresh()</code> is then called at later times, either the content
 * is successfully cached then (and the initial exception is irrelevant) or
 * the exception is refreshed.<p>
 * <p/>
 * If - once the content is initially cached - subsequent attempts to
 * <code>refresh()</code> the the cache fail, all content accessing methods will
 * still revert to the cached data. <br>
 * If you then want to find out the cause for the failure of subsequent calls to
 * <code>refresh()</code>, you will have to register a RefreshListener, as
 * the callback method defined there will include the IOException in case of an
 * unsuccessful refresh attempt.<p>
 * <p/>
 * A special case is if the content data of the embedded URL is too large
 * to currently fit into memory; i.e. caching is impossible, although the URL
 * is accessible. In that case, methods like <code>getContentAsString()</code>
 * will return an IOException with the message that the data content is too
 * large to fit into memory, while other methods (like
 * <code>saveContentToFile()</code> or <code>getInputStream()</code>)
 * will then directly work off the online content.
 * Even though many operations may probably be quite difficult with content
 * that cannot be cached due to its size, the method
 * <code>saveContentToFile()</code> can still be used savely regardless of
 * the size of the content (of course it may take quite a bit of time).
 * The method <code>tooLargeForCaching()</code> will indicate whether this
 * is the case. Note that a later call to <code>refresh()</code>  - after
 * some memory has been freed up - may be able to cache the same object
 * successfully. <p>
 * <p/>
 * In addition, this class maintains a static map serving as an application-wide
 * cache for URLCache objects, which can be accessed using the put() and get()
 * methods. <p>
 * <p/>
 * Currently, this implementation starts a new thread whenever refresh() is
 * called. A future revision may want to revise the performance overhead
 * associated with this. The implementation is suited for large content
 * on slow networks, so that it makes sense to load the data for each
 * URL in a separate thread simultaneously.<p>
 * <p/>
 * Note that many methods assume that the underlying content is HTML data;
 * if that is untrue for a specific object, these methods may return empty
 * objects.<p>
 * <p/>
 * Note that the only data that is actually cached is a byte array that
 * represents the content fetched from the URL and a header map;
 * all other information (title, links, images, etc.) will be calculated each
 * time based on the cached byte array.
