/**
 * GamePlay provides all methods needed to play a game.
 * A game is played by players represented by integer game roles.
 * It is  assumed that an integer should always be sufficient to
 * represent a game role. AutoPlay then introduces the concept
 * of Player objects more in detail.
 * Further assumptions for GamePlay objects are that as long as the
 * game is in progress, there is a finite set of moves that can
 * be performed in any given game status and one of the moves
 * can be picked to advance the game to another state with its
 * own set of legal moves. Another important assumption is that
 * given any game status, there is always one player determinable
 * that makes the next move (if the game is not over).
 * Instead of implementing all functionality from scratch, it is
 * recommended to take advantage of classes that already provide
 * a good portion of the functionality - such as AbstractGame; for
 * many games, this class provides a good basis.
 * There are games that have many different variants of legal moves,
 * which may be hard to return with getLegalMoves(). If that is the
 * case, getLegalMoves() could simply return templates for legal moves;
 * the method isLegalMoves() would then be responsible to determine
 * whether the move constructed by a player is actually legal. This is
 * why both functions are part of this interface.
 * GamePlay extends Serializable to ensure that a game and its
 * moves can be used over e.g. an Internet connection or can be
 * written to a file.
