 * InterceptPlayer is an intermediate Player object that allows any

 * calls to selectMove() and return the value set by the object controlling
 * the monitor. One potential use for this Player object is to e.g. place it
 * into a SocketPlayerServer and then have a GUI wait for move selection
 * requests that this InterceptPlayer will pass on. into the constructor.
 * Apart from that, it acts as a RandomPlayer.
