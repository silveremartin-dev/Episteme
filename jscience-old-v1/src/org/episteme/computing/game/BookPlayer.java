/**
 * BookPlayer is a Player wrapper that can significantly improve normal
 * Player performance by predefining move selections. This is achieved by
 * internally using a Hashtable object as a <dfn>book</dfn>. When asked to
 * select a move in a game, the BookPlayer first checks its book (Hashtable)
 * to see whether a given game is present as a key; If so, it will return the
 * GameMove object stored as the associated value to that key (which is
 * assumed to be the desired move earlier put in the book (which is the
 * Hashtable). Only if the GameBook doesn't contain the game in question, the
 * selection is passed on to the embedded Player object for standard
 * procedure, as all other requests defined in the Player interface are routed
 * to the embedded player as well. Naturally, the BookPlayer relies on a
 * properly maintained book to perform well.
