/**
 * Utility class for doing local->window transformations for case where
 * Canvas3D is a simple display such as a monitor. This won't work for the
 * more complex cases (i.e. a multiple canvases, head tracking, etc).
 *
 * Usage:
 *    // after the canvas and node are created
 *    LocalToWindow locToWindow = LocalToWindow(node, canvas);
 *    ...
 *    // when we need to transform (canvas location and node transforms may have
 *    // changed)
 *    locToWindow.update(); // make sure transforms are up to date
 *
 *    Point3d[] localPts = <some local coords to transform >
 *    Point[] windowPts = <the area to put the tranformed pts >
 *    for (int i = 0; i < localPts.length; i++) {
 *       locToWindow.transformPt(localPts[i], windowPts[i]);
 *    }
