 * Interface for cloneable classes. A cloneable class implements the standard

 * in the mists of time, the J2SE's {@link java.lang.Cloneable} interface
 * doesn't declare the <code>clone()</code> method, which make it hard to use.
 * This <code>Cloneable</code> interface add this missing method, which avoid
 * the need to cast an interface to its implementation in order to clone it.
