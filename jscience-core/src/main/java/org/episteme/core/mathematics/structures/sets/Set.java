/**
 * Represents a mathematical set - a collection of distinct elements.
 * <p>
 * This is the foundational concept in mathematics. A set has no additional
 * structure
 * beyond membership. Higher-level structures (Magma, Group, Ring, Field) add
 * operations
 * and properties to sets.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
 * <p>
 * A set S is a well-defined collection of distinct objects, considered as a
 * whole.
 * The objects are called elements or members of the set.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Ã¢â€žâ€¢ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} - Natural numbers</li>
 * <li>Ã¢â€žÂ¤ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...} - Integers</li>
 * <li>Ã¢â€žÂ - Real numbers</li>
 * <li>Ã¢â€žâ€š - Complex numbers</li>
