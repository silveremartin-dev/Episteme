/**
 * A ring is an abelian group with a second binary operation (multiplication).
 * <p>
 * Rings are fundamental algebraic structures that generalize arithmetic.
 * They appear throughout mathematics, from number theory to algebraic geometry.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
 * <p>
 * A ring (R, +, Ãƒâ€”) consists of:
 * <ol>
 * <li>A set R</li>
 * <li>An addition operation + making (R, +) an abelian group</li>
 * <li>A multiplication operation Ãƒâ€” satisfying:
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Closure</strong>: Ã¢Ë†â‚¬ a, b Ã¢Ë†Ë† R: a Ãƒâ€” b Ã¢Ë†Ë† R</li>
 * <li><strong>Associativity</strong>: (a Ãƒâ€” b) Ãƒâ€” c = a Ãƒâ€” (b Ãƒâ€” c)</li>
 * <li><strong>Distributivity</strong>: a Ãƒâ€” (b + c) = (a Ãƒâ€” b) + (a Ãƒâ€” c) and (a +
 * b) Ãƒâ€” c = (a Ãƒâ€” c) + (b Ãƒâ€” c)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>(Ã¢â€žÂ¤, +, Ãƒâ€”) - Integers (commutative ring with unity)</li>
 * <li>(Ã¢â€žÂ, +, Ãƒâ€”) - Real numbers (field, thus also a ring)</li>
 * <li>(MÃ¢â€šâ€š(Ã¢â€žÂ), +, Ãƒâ€”) - 2Ãƒâ€”2 real matrices (non-commutative ring)</li>
 * <li>(Ã¢â€žÂ¤/nÃ¢â€žÂ¤, +, Ãƒâ€”) - Integers modulo n</li>
 * <li>(Ã¢â€žÂ[x], +, Ãƒâ€”) - Polynomials with real coefficients</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Special Types of Rings</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li><strong>Commutative Ring</strong>: Multiplication commutes (a Ãƒâ€” b = b Ãƒâ€”
 * a)</li>
 * <li><strong>Ring with Unity</strong>: Has multiplicative identity (1)</li>
 * <li><strong>Integral Domain</strong>: Commutative ring with unity, no zero
 * divisors</li>
 * <li><strong>Division Ring</strong>: Every non-zero element has multiplicative
 * inverse</li>
 * <li><strong>Field</strong>: Commutative division ring</li>
 * </ul>
