 * A Kleene Algebra is an idempotent semiring with a closure operator (Kleene

 * <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
 * <p>
 * A Kleene algebra (K, +, Ã‚Â·, *, 0, 1) is an idempotent semiring (a + a = a)
 * equipped with a unary operation * satisfying:
 * <ul>
 * <li>1 + a Ã‚Â· a* Ã¢â€°Â¤ a*</li>
 * <li>1 + a* Ã‚Â· a Ã¢â€°Â¤ a*</li>
 * <li>b + a Ã‚Â· x Ã¢â€°Â¤ x Ã¢â€¡â€™ a* Ã‚Â· b Ã¢â€°Â¤ x</li>
 * <li>b + x Ã‚Â· a Ã¢â€°Â¤ x Ã¢â€¡â€™ b Ã‚Â· a* Ã¢â€°Â¤ x</li>
 * </ul>
 * where a Ã¢â€°Â¤ b is defined as a + b = b.
