 * Represents a mathematical transform (e.g., Fourier, Laplace, Wavelet).

 * A transform maps a function or signal from one domain (e.g., time) to another
 * (e.g., frequency). Transforms are bijective, meaning they have well-defined
 * inverses (e.g., Fourier Ã¢â€ â€ Inverse Fourier).

 * <li><b>Wavelet Transform</b>: signal Ã¢â€ â€ time-frequency representation</li>
