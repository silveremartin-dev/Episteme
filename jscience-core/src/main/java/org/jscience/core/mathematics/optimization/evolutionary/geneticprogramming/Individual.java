/**
 * <p/>
 * This class combines a program and its computed fitness values.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <b>Raw fitness</b> is the measurement of fitness that is stated in the natural
 * terminology of the problem itself. The most common definition of raw
 * fitness is error: If the S-expression is boolean-valued or
 * symbolic-valued, the sum of distances is equivalent to the number of
 * mismatches. If the S-expression is real-valued or integer-valued,
 * the square root of the sum of the squares of the distances can,
 * alternatively, be used to measure the fitness. (therefore increasing
 * the influence of more distant points)
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <b>Standardized fitness</b> restates the raw fitness so that a lower numerical
 * value is always a better value.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * It is convenient and desirable to make the best value of standardized
 * fitness equal 0. If this is not already the case, it can be made so by
 * subtracting (or adding a constant).
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * If for a particular problem, a greater value of raw fitness is better,
 * standardized fitness must be computed from raw fitness. In that situation,
 * standardized fitness equals the maximum possible value of raw fitness(Rmax)
 * minus the observed raw fitness. For ex. If the artifical ant finds 5 0f 89
 * pieces of food using a given computer program, the raw fitness is 5 and
 * the standardized fitness is 84.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <b>Adjusted fitness</b> a(i,t) is computed from the standardized fitness s(i,t)
 * as follows: --- a(i,t) = 1 / 1+s(i,t) --- where s(i,t) is the standardized
 * fitness for individual i at time t.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The adjusted fitness lies between 0 and 1. The adjusted fitness is bigger
 * for better individuals in the population. Note that for certain methods
 * of selection other than fitness proportionate selection (e.g. tournament
 * selection and rank selection), adjusted fitness is not relevant and not
 * used.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <b>Normalized fitness</b> is also needed if the method of selection employed is
 * fitness proportionate.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * The normalized fitness n(i,t) is computed from the adjusted fitness a(i,t)
 * as described in <b>Koza's book (ISBN:0262111705)</b>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * Note that for certain methods of selection other than fitness proportionate
 * selection (e.g. tournament selection and rank selection), normalized fitness
 * is not relevant and not used.
