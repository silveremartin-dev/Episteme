/**
 * A magma is a set equipped with a binary operation.
 * <p>
 * This is the simplest algebraic structure with an operation. The operation
 * is not required to be associative, commutative, or have an identity element.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
 * <p>
 * A magma (S, Ã¢Ë†â€”) consists of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>A set S</li>
 * <li>A binary operation Ã¢Ë†â€” : S Ãƒâ€” S Ã¢â€ â€™ S</li>
 * </ul>
 * The only requirement is closure: for all a, b Ã¢Ë†Ë† S, a Ã¢Ë†â€” b Ã¢Ë†Ë† S.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>(Ã¢â€žâ€¢, Ã¢Ë†â€™) - Natural numbers with subtraction (not a semigroup, not
 * associative)</li>
 * <li>(Ã¢â€žÂ¤, ÃƒÂ·) - Integers with division (not closed, only a partial magma)</li>
 * <li>(Ã¢â€žÂ, +) - Real numbers with addition (actually a group)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Hierarchy</h2>
 *
 * <pre>
 * Magma (closure)
 * Ã¢â€ â€œ
 * Semigroup (+ associativity)
 * Ã¢â€ â€œ
 * Monoid (+ identity)
 * Ã¢â€ â€œ
 * Group (+ inverse)
 * </pre>
