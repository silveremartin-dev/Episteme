 * A Loop is a Quasigroup with an identity element.

 * A Quasigroup is a Magma where division is always possible (Latin Square
 * property).
 * A Loop adds the requirement of a neutral element (identity).
 * Unlike Groups, Loops are not required to be associative.

 * <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
 * <p>
 * A loop (L, Ã‚Â·) is a set L with a binary operation Ã‚Â· such that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>For every a, b Ã¢Ë†Ë† L, there exist unique x, y Ã¢Ë†Ë† L such that a Ã‚Â· x = b and y
 * Ã‚Â· a = b.</li>
 * <li>There exists an identity element e Ã¢Ë†Ë† L such that a Ã‚Â· e = a and e Ã‚Â· a = a
 * for all a Ã¢Ë†Ë† L.</li>
 * </ul>
