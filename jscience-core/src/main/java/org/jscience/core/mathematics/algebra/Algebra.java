 * <p>
 * An algebra A over a field K is a vector space equipped with a binary
 * operation
 * (x, y) Ã¢â€ Â¦ x Ã‚Â· y such that for all x, y, z Ã¢Ë†Ë† A and a, b Ã¢Ë†Ë† K:
 * <ul>
 * <li>(x + y) Ã‚Â· z = x Ã‚Â· z + y Ã‚Â· z</li>
 * <li>x Ã‚Â· (y + z) = x Ã‚Â· y + x Ã‚Â· z</li>
 * <li>(ax) Ã‚Â· (by) = (ab) (x Ã‚Â· y)</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Square matrices (MÃ¢â€šâ„¢(K))</li>
 * <li>Polynomials (K[x])</li>
 * <li>Complex numbers (as Ã¢â€žÂ-algebra)</li>
 * <li>Quaternions (as Ã¢â€žÂ-algebra)</li>
 * <li>Lie Algebras (with bracket [x,y] as product)</li>
