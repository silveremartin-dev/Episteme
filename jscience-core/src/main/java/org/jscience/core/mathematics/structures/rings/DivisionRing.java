 * A division ring (also known as a skew field) is a ring in which every

 *
 * <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
 * <p>
 * A division ring (D, +, Ãƒâ€”) is a ring with unity (1 Ã¢â€°Â  0) such that:
 * <ul>
 * <li>For every a Ã¢Ë†Ë† D \ {0}, there exists aÃ¢ÂÂ»Ã‚Â¹ Ã¢Ë†Ë† D such that a Ãƒâ€” aÃ¢ÂÂ»Ã‚Â¹ = aÃ¢ÂÂ»Ã‚Â¹ Ãƒâ€” a =
 * 1</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Ã¢â€žÂ - Quaternions (non-commutative)</li>
 * <li>Field - Commutative division ring</li>
 * </ul>
