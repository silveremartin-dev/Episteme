 * Represents an affine space.
 * <p>
 * An affine space is a geometric structure that generalizes properties of
 * Euclidean spaces
 * in which parallel lines remain parallel. It consists of points and vectors,
 * where vectors
 * can be added to points to get new points, and two points can be subtracted to
 * get a vector.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Key properties:
 * - Points can be translated by vectors
 * - The difference of two points is a vector
 * - Linear combinations (interpolation) are supported
