/**
 * A semiring (or rig) is an algebraic structure similar to a ring, but without
 * the requirement that each element must have an additive inverse.
 * <p>
 * A semiring (R, +, Ãƒâ€”) consists of:
 * <ul>
 * <li>(R, +) is a commutative monoid with identity element 0.</li>
 * <li>(R, Ãƒâ€”) is a monoid with identity element 1.</li>
 * <li>Multiplication distributes over addition.</li>
 * <li>Multiplication by 0 annihilates R: 0 Ãƒâ€” a = a Ãƒâ€” 0 = 0.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The term "rig" is a pun on "ring": a ring without "n" (negative).
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>(Ã¢â€žâ€¢, +, Ãƒâ€”) - Natural numbers (including 0)</li>
 * <li>(Boolean Algebra, Ã¢Ë†Â¨, Ã¢Ë†Â§) - Booleans with OR as addition, AND as
 * multiplication</li>
 * <li>(Languages, Ã¢Ë†Âª, Ã‚Â·) - Formal languages with union and concatenation</li>
