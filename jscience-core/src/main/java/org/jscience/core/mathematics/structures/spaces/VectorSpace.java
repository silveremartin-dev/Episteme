 * A vector space is a module over a field.

 *
 * <h2>Mathematical Definition</h2>
 * <p>
 * A vector space V over a field F is a module where the scalar ring is a field.
 * Elements of V are called vectors, elements of F are called scalars.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Ã¢â€žÂÃ¢ÂÂ¿ (Euclidean space)</li>
 * <li>Ã¢â€žâ€šÃ¢ÂÂ¿ (Complex coordinate space)</li>
 * <li>Function spaces (e.g., LÃ‚Â²)</li>
 * <li>Polynomial spaces</li>
 * </ul>
