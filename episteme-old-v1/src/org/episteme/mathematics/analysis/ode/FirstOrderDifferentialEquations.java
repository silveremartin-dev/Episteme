/**
 * This interface represents a first order differential equations set.
 * <p/>
 * <p>This interface should be implemented by all real first order
 * differential equation problems before they can be handled by the
 * integrators {@link FirstOrderIntegrator#integrate} method.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>A first order differential equations problem, as seen by an
 * integrator is the time derivative <code>dY/dt</code> of a state
 * vector <code>Y</code>, both being one dimensional arrays. From the
 * integrator point of view, this derivative depends only on the
 * current time <code>t</code> and on the state vector
 * <code>Y</code>.</p>
 * <p/>
 * <p>For real problems, the derivative depends also on parameters
 * that do not belong to the state vector (dynamical model constants
 * for example). These constants are completely outside of the scope
 * of this interface, the classes that implement it are allowed to
 * handle them as they want.</p>
