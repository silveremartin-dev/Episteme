              - in procedure detect_collision; and
              - in calculation of ra/dec.
            These ephemerides can be corrected for light time-of-flight relative to position r[], depending on the value of the int light_flight.  Note that these light-time corrections are high-accuracy, based on an iterative algorithm which includes relativistic delays (see P. Kenneth Seidelmann, Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac, 1992, pp.147-149).  Iterative light-time corrections are also applied in calculating Newtonian accelerations, though relativistic corrections are not included.
            Calculated values are output to instance variables planet_r[][], planet_rprime[][], and planet_r2prime[][].
            Note that the planets are initially enumerated as follows:  Mercury = 1, Venus = 2, Earth-Moon barycenter = 3, Mars = 4, ... , Pluto = 9, Geocentric Moon = 10, Sun = 11.  However, the output order will be: Sun = 0, Mercury = 1, Venus = 2, Earth = 3, Mars = 4, ... , Pluto = 9, Moon = 10.

            The output will be the epoch state vector, and the epoch error covariance matrix (all of which are instance variables of the MinorPlanet class).
            We will assume a maximum of 2000 optical observations, 100 radar delay observations, and 100 radar doppler observations.
            Provision is made for excluding observations whose chi or residuals exceed user-defined thresholds; although these observations will not be deleted, they will not be used in the final iterations of the algorithm.

This new condition uses the observed fact that the RMS residuals decrease with successive loops until the next loop results in almost no change.  At this point, the solution has converged.)

Note that this requires integrating the normal density function over the planet's disk.  However, we are making a pretty huge simplification already by projecting onto the "impact plane", in order to predict the probability of collision before or after the time of nominal closest approach.  Therefore, I feel justified in approximating this integral.
                 The integral would be over all a and b that cover the planet's disk.  I will approximate this numerically three different ways.  First, by evaluating the ndf at the planet's center and multiplying by the area of the planet's disk.  Second, by evaluating the ndf at four points along the a and b axes, and multiplying by area/4.  Third, by evaluating the ndf at four points along the a-b diagonals, and multiplying by area/4.  And finally, I will average these approximations to arrive at a final result.
                 You have to stop somewhere, and I feel that this covers the disk fairly well.

          Procedure to calculate the accelerations on a body for use in the differential equations of motion in Cowell's method.  First, we calculate the gravitational perturbations due to the planets, using the barycentric relativistic equation for point-mass acceleration (Ref:  P. Kenneth Seidelmann, "Explanatory Supplement to the Astronomical Almanac", 1992, p. 281), and then the perturbing acceleration on a comet due to reactive water vaporization (Refs:  Brian G. Marsden, "Comets and Non-Gravitational Forces II", The Astronomical Journal Vol 74 No. 5, pp. 720-734; B.G. Marsden, Z. Sekanina, D.K. Yeomans, "Comets and Non-Gravitational Forces V", The Astronomical Journal, Vol 78 No. 2, pp. 211-225; D.K. Yeomans and P.W. Chodas, "An Asymmetric Outgassing Model for Cometary Nongravitational Accelerations", The Astronomical Journal, Vol 98 No. 3, pp. 1083-1093).
          Note that jultime is a Julian date, r[] is the barycentric position vector in A.U.s of the body in question, rprime[] is the barycentric velocity in AU/day, and acceleration() is the acceleration vector on the body given in AU/day^3.
          Note also that planet_r(I,j) represent the j'th component of the position of the I'th solar system body, planet_rprime(I,j) represent the j'th component of the velocity of the I'th solar system body, and planet_r2prime(I,j) represent the j'th component of the Newtonian acceleration of the I'th solar system body.

It may be counterintuitive, but there's no strange physics involved (beyond gravity itself, which is of course an open issue); it turns out that way when computing the derivatives of time retarded vector & scalar potentials. Higher-order terms exist but are insignificant at solar system speeds (much less than speed of light).

The Julian day of the epoch to which the elements refer is "jdepoch".
          Note:  Station coordinates are inward pointing; that is, vectors x, y, and z point from the observer to the barycenter of the solar system.
          Note:  In order to prevent divergence, the values of rho (slant range) are monitored.  If negative rhos occur, their sign is changed.  If convergence has not occurred by the 50th iteration, or if the rhos are diverging, the new value of rhos is taken to be the average of the indicated value with the three previous values.  This technique is due to Marsden. If convergence has not occurred by the 200th iteration, calculation is halted, the "kgaussfail" flag is set to 3, and the initial approximation is returned.
          The kgaussfail flag (returned as r1[0]) can have the following meanings:
             kgaussfail = 1 or 2 means a problem has been encountered in method sector, and the method has failed.
             kgaussfail = 3 means over 200 iterations have occurred without convergence; the initial approximation will be returned.

          Procedure to use the Laplace method to determine a preliminary orbit using three sets of optical observations.

          Algorithm taken from Pedro Escobal, "Methods of Orbit Determination", pp. 261-270.

          Note:  Station coordinates (x, y, and z) should be in heliocentric units, and times in Julian days.  The state vector r2 (and r2prime) are given in heliocentric units (per canonical time unit).  The Julian day of the epoch to which the elements refer is "jdepoch", which is returned.

          Note:  Station coordinates are inward pointing; that is, vectors x, y, and z point from the observer to the barycenter of the solar system.

          Note:  Due to the vaguaries of the Java compiler, I must reuse variable names, as follows:

            Method to calculate the least squares best-fit orbit of a comet, given optical, radar delay, and or radar doppler observations.  The process is repeated until the magnitude of the corrections to the epoch state vector is less than some percentage of their corresponding covariances.
            The method presumes that an a priori state vector has been selected, and resides in epoch_r, epoch_rprime, and epoch_time.  The method also assumes that the observations have been ordered from earliest to most recent.
            The method presumes that the user has selected a value for non-gravitational thrust parameter DT; the method will initialize values for non-gravitational thrust parameters A1 and A2, and iteratively solve for best-fit values.
            The output will be the epoch state vector, A1 and A2, and the epoch error covariance matrix (all of which are instance variables of the MinorPlanet class).
            Provision is made for excluding observations whose chi or residuals exceed user-defined thresholds; although these observations will not be deleted, they will not be used in the final iterations of the algorithm.

          (Note that this condition was not my original choice.  I tried requiring that the corrections to the epoch state vector must be less than some percentage of their corresponding covariances.  However, real-world data is not sufficiently smooth.  This new condition uses the observed fact that the RMS residuals decrease with successive loops until the next loop results in almost no change.  At this point, the solution has converged.)
          Clearly, this condition will not be satisfied initially, so we will go through the loop at least once.
          NOTE:  MUST ACCOUNT FOR DIVERGENCE, AS MEASURED BY INCREASING RMS RESIDUALS.  If the RMS residuals increase from one loop to the next, the divergence flag will be set, and the original solution returned.

A minimum of one measurement is needed to calculate the G and H parameters.  So I believe we are faced with three cases.  Either we have zero visual-range brightness measurements, or we have exactly one visual-range brightness measurement, or we have two or more visual-range brightness measurements.  In the first case, G and H are indeterminate.  In the second case, G and H are precisely determined.  In the third case, G and H are overdetermined, and we must use least-squares. */

Moreover, the sensitivity matrix is ill-conditioned; the partial wrt H is exactly one, while the partial wrt G is approx. -1.  As a result, least-squares does not converge well.  For this reason, I tried a brute-force alternative approach; for each value of G (in increments of 0.01), calculate the range of H's, then run through each H in the range (in increments of 0.1) and determine which combination gave the lowest rms residuals.  This was simply too computationally intensive. */

          (Note that this condition was not my original choice.  I tried requiring that the corrections to the epoch state vector must be less than some percentage of their corresponding covariances.  However, real-world data is not sufficiently smooth.  This new condition uses the observed fact that the RMS residuals decrease with successive loops until the next loop results in almost no change.  At this point, the solution has converged.)
          Clearly, this condition will not be satisfied initially, so we will go through the loop at least once.
          NOTE:  MUST ACCOUNT FOR DIVERGENCE, AS MEASURED BY INCREASING RMS RESIDUALS.  If each of the RMS residuals increase from one loop to the next, the divergence flag will be set, and the original solution returned.
