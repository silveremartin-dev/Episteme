/**
 * An interface defining functionality of a BibRefCollection (which is a main
 * entry point to the queryied bibliographic repositories).
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * A BibRefQuery represents a collection of {@link BibRef Bibliographic
 * references}, and can be used for refining the collection by asking queries,
 * and/or to retrive the contents of the collection.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * <u>The implementations are advised to used the following constructor:</u>
 * <pre>
 *    public <em>NameOfAnImplementation</em> (String[] args, Hashtable props) {...}
 * </pre>
 * where both <tt>args</tt> and <tt>props</tt> contain implementation specific
 * parameters and properties. However, some properties are more probable to be
 * used - the suggested names for them are defined either in this interface or
 * in the "sister" interface {@link BibRefSupport}.
