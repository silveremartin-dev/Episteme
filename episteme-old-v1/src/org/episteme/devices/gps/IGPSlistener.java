 * <li>
 * The GPS does not necessarily transmit these things periodially by itself!
 * Some GPS-units needs a request before transmitting anything. Use the method
 * GPS.setAutoTransmission(true) if you want the GPS to periodically send this
 * data.

 * Don't perform any long calculations or big operations in these methods.
 * They're called by a dispatching thread, and putting it to too much work
 * will slow performance on the communication with the GPS.
