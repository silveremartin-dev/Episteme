/**
 * This class is intended to provide a common interface for the more complicated
 * neural network training algorithms, such as a multi-stage Kohonen training
 * algorithm. {@link org.episteme.computing.ai.neurocomputing.NeuralNetwork#train(double[],double[])
 * should only implement one iteration of the training algorithm, and if this
 * algorithm has multiple stages, variables or other complicating factors, it
 * may be easier to use <code>NeuralNetworkTrainer</code> to provide the overall
 * framework.
 * <p/>
 * In addition to this, a <code>NeuralNetworkTrainer</code>-derived class can be
 * created to deal with a specific training situation. Continuing with our Kohonen
 * example, you could create a trainer for simple 2D shapes, mapping RGB colours,
 * or complex image association.
 * <p/>
 * Finally, <code>NeuralNetworkTrainer</code> also implements <code>Steppable</code>
 * adding greater flexibility/integration when creating demonstration applets/
 * applications.
