//see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tessellation_of_space
//and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_uniform_planar_tilings for some possible additional implementations

//todo provide some implementations for triangular and hexagonal cells

//There is no platonic solid for the sphere above 20 faces and we can't therefore produce any regular tesselation of the sphere
//We can't neither provide a tesselation for a full ball.
//yet we should provide a class to do that the best we can, this would probably be very useful for astrophysics and climatology simulations.
