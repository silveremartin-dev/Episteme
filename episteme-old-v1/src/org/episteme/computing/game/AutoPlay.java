/**
 * AutoPlay adds AI capabilites to a GamePlay by mapping Player objects
 * to the game roles of a GamePlay. This enables
 * to play against/with automated and intelligent opponents.
 * This also provides the basis for any type of automated game simulation.
 * <br>A word on the association of Player objects to GamePlay objects:
 * <br>A GamePlay object (read: a game) has a certain number of 'game roles',
 * each role can be assigned to a player. It is, however, possible that one
 * Player object plays more than just one role in a given game (to account
 * for any type of game setup). This is why - when dealing with game roles -
 * an array of game roles is passed on instead of just one game role.
