 * GameMove provides the necessary methods that allow a <code>GamePlay</code>

 * to retrieve the game role associated with the move, as every move will have
 * to be played by a particular player. GameMove represents a move that can be
 * applied to a GamePlay object. GameMove extends Serializable to ensure that
 * a game and its moves can be used over e.g. an Internet connection or can be
 * written to a file. It is advised to also implement a useful
 * <code>toString()</code> method, so that the moves will be displayed
 * properly.
