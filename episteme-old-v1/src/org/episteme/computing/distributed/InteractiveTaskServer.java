 * Remote interface for clients to connect to a server managing interactive
 * tasks.  The server and clients work as follows:
 * <p/>
 * <ol>
 * <li>
 * Client gets handle of server through RMI and calls the getID method. From
 * then on this client will always use this ID when communicating to the
 * server.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Client will ask for the task and then start running it.
 * </li>
 * <li>
 * Client will regularly call the interact method to exchange I/O with the
 * server.
 * </li>
 * </ol>
 * </p>
 * The reason this is not in the server package is that it is not a server side
 * only object.  Ie the client must know about it.
