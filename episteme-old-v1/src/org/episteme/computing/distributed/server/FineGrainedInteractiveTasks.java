/**
 * Provides an abstraction to run many interactive tasks concurrently so that
 * if one stops before others it can be replaced by a new task. It also
 * enables tasks to be replaced at any time by the server.
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * This is achieved by the server being informed of which tasks are still alive
 * when it calls the get method and by the server sending out the same or new
 * tasks through the set method. If the same task as the current one is sent
 * then it is ignored. WARNING: Task equality is based on the toString()
 * method.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * If a task is sent that the client has previously completed there is an
 * option to ignore this task, but the current implementation will run this
 * task anyway since in many cases this is not a useless functionality.  To
 * reenable this option see line marked with !!.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <p/>
 * This assumes InteractiveTask implementations will be well behaved and check
 * their currentThread.isInterrupted() method.
