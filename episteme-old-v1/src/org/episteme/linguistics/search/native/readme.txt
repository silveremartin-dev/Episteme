Although the files are located in org.episteme.linguistics.search.native, they should be in org.episteme.linguistics.search. They were moved here for readability only.

Before building the native library, you MUST copy at least jni.h to this directory.

Try

	> locate jni.h

and copy all the include files to this directory.

To build the native library,

	> ./configure
	> make

should be enough. The library is compiled in the .libs directory.
