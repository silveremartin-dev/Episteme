//Validity of the tree model. A tree isn't always the best model. Here are some times when it isn't best. 
//For individuals within a species. The genetic material of an individual doesn't derive from a single earlier existing individual. Animals and plants that multiply by sexual reproduction receive half their genetic material from each of two parents, so a tree like this is inappropriate. For species that multiply asexually, a tree is appropriate. Even for species that usually multiply asexually�such as many one-celled creatures�the occassional exchange of genetic material through conjugation is so important that trees are inappropriate. 
//For closely related species. Individuals do occasionaly mate between closely related species, and their progeny survive to contribute to the gene pool of one or both of the parent species. As the species diverge, such intermixing of genetic material becomes more rare. One solution is to treat closely related species as one larger variable species. Another is simply not to consider closely related species. 
//Hybrid species. In the plant world it occassionally happens that a new tetraploid species arises from two diploid species. The two parent species need to be somewhat related for this to happen. 
//Distant interaction. There are a couple of ways that genetic material from one species can find its way into a distantly related or unrelated species. Among bacteria, sometimes a bacterium of one species can injest the genetic material of a bacterium of another species and incorporate part of it into its own genetic material. Rare as this may be, the effects are significant. Sometimes viruses can inadvertantly transport genetic material from one species to another. When some viruses break out of cells of one species, they may infect other species and carry that material to them. 
//In spite of these exceptions, a tree model is usually a pretty good model to show the relations among species.
